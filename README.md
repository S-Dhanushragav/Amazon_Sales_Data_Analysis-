#Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project  
Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Amazon's sales data, aimed at uncovering key patterns, trends, and insights to optimize business strategies. The analysis utilizes various data science techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering, and dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE), to examine sales performance, customer behavior, and fulfillment methods. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can drive marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement strategies for Amazon.

##Key Objectives
Sales Trend Analysis: Identify seasonal sales spikes and trends during major shopping events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and the holiday season.
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to create targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers.
Fulfillment Method Analysis: Compare the sales performance and customer satisfaction between products fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) and third-party sellers.
Geographic Sales Distribution: Analyze the sales performance across different regions and understand how location influences purchasing behavior.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in sales data, which may represent bulk purchases or special transactions.
Sales by Product Category: Visualize sales distribution across different product categories to understand which categories drive the most revenue.
Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data cleaning, missing value imputation, and outlier detection.
Clustering: Customer segmentation using K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce high-dimensional data for easier visualization and clustering.
Data Visualization: Various plots, including line plots, boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots, to explore the relationships between sales and different factors like time, category, and customer behavior.
Python Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Scikit-learn for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Plotly for interactive visualizations.
Results
Peak Sales Periods: Spikes in sales during Prime Day and Black Friday, as well as consistent sales growth during the holiday season.
Customer Segments: Three key customer groups identified: Frequent Buyers, Occasional Shoppers, and Holiday Shoppers, each with distinct shopping behaviors.
Fulfillment Performance: Products fulfilled by FBA showed higher sales and customer satisfaction compared to third-party seller fulfillment.
Regional Insights: Urban areas exhibited higher sales, and specific regions showed distinct preferences for product categories, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory allocation.
Outliers: Bulk purchases or special transactions identified as outliers, highlighting the potential for expanding into B2B markets.
Category Performance: High-performing categories such as electronics and home goods drive the majority of sales.
